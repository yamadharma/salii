This directory contains patches against other packages used by SystemImager.

The naming convention for kernel patches is:
    packagename.description.patch

Patches are applied in the order in which the filenames sort.  For example, 
linux.i386.10reiserfs.patch would be applied before linux.i386.20raid.patch.

Here is a listing of each patch, and a URL to the original patch, or to the
source from which the patch was derived.
