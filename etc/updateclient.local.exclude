#  Function:  
#    This is a list of files to exclude DURING THE UPDATECLIENT PROCESS 
#    ONLY.  If you want to exclude files or directories during an
#    "si_getimage" operation, use "man si_getimage" or "si_getimage --help"
#    to see the "--exclude PATH" and "--exclude-file FILE" options.
#


# Do NOT modify these exclusions or VERY STRANGE things may happen!

#
# You should consider modifying this file on both on the client and in
# the image stored on the image server.  If you only modify it on the 
# client, it will be replaced by the one in the image you are updating
# to.  If you only modify it in the image, you will need to run 
# updateclient twice for it to take effect.  The first run will pull 
# the new file to your client, and the second run will actually make 
# use of the new file.
