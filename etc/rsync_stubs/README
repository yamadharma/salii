This directory holds the rsync stub files.  These files are used to re-create
SystemImager's rsyncd.conf file.  If you need to make changes to the 
rsyncd.conf file, you do that by changing one of the stub files or by creating
a new stub file.  Stub files are put into the rsyncd.conf file in order.  
Therefore, a stub file starting with a 10 will go in before a file starting 
with a 20.  

The "99local" stub file is provided for your customizing pleasure.  Simply add
your changes to this file, and run the "mkrsyncd_conf" command to re-generate
a fresh rsyncd.conf file with your changes.

Stub files have a very specific naming scheme to prevent README files, backup 
files, and similar from being used.  For a stub file to be used, that stub 
file's name must:
o start with one or more digits
o have one or more letters and or underscores
o have no other characters

Valid examples:
 99bob
 35johnny_rotten
 50_bobby_sue

Invalid examples:
 35johnny_rotten~       # Tilde (~) not allowed
 S50_bobby_sue          # Can't start with a letter (S)
 40johnny_rotten.bak    # .bak indicates a backup file

Therefore, to create a backup file that won't be used, simply:
"mv 40johnny_rotten 40johnny_rotten.bak"
"mkrsyncd_conf"
