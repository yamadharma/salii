              This is the SystemImager autoinstall system

 Your autoinstall has failed.  You can use the shell prompt to try and see 
 what happened.  You may be able to use the <Shift>+<Page Up> keys to scroll 
 back and see the text that has passed off the top of the screen.  You can use 
 <alt>+<f2>, <f3>, or <f4> to work at an alternate shell prompt and preserve 
 your messages on the main screen, which is on <alt>+<f1>.  Then go back and 
 re-read the documentation to see if your problem is described there.  
 You have read the documentation, right? :-)

 If you absolutely cannot figure it out, visit the SystemImager support page 
 at http://systemimager.org.  There you can search the email list  archives,
 ask your question on IRC, or even join a mailing list to ask your question.
 There's a good chance someone else has experienced this very same issue and
 can help answer your question.  If you find the answer and it's not in the
 documentation, or if you identify a bug, please submit a bug report at the
 SystemImager support page. 
 
 Have fun!  http://systemimager.org
