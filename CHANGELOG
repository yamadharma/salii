1.7.0
  * This version of SALI is a complete rewrite of the /etc/init.d/functions
    also the old master_script style is from this version deprecated.

  * Changes:
    * The file in /etc/init.d/functions now sources library files in /lib/sali/*.sh
    * The /bin/startup and /bin/installer have been moved and renamed to 
      /sbin/sali_startup and /sbin/sali_installer
    * All variables used by sali starts with SALI_ (except for network configuration)
    * Added a new directory /etc/sali which contains the error_message file, default values
      for variables, etc

  * PLEASE NOTE that this version of SALI breaks compatibility with systemimager, it could
    also be possible that some minor changes must be made in your current master_scripts

1.6.2
  * Fixed a bug when using the partition command with value 0 (use the rest
