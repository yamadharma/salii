1.5.0

  * Fixed a bug in detecting scsi disks, closes #26

    When function find_all_disks_by_dev() is used loop over the:
       - /dev/disk/{by-path by-id by-label} directories
       - to find all the disks

    Function find_all_disks_by_lsscsi() is simplified so we did not
    skip valid scsi disks
