=head1 NAME

systemimager-rsyncd.conf - the rsyncd.conf file associated with SystemImager

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SystemImager uses rsync running as a daemon on the Image Server in
order to function.  The I<rsyncd.conf> file is very similar to a
vanilla rsyncd.conf file, however certain modules are required for
SystemImager to properly function.

This file is automatically generated by the si_mkrsyncd_conf command from
stub files in /etc/systemimager/rsync_stubs.  Do not make any changes to this 
file directly.  Instead, create an appropriate file in 
/etc/systemimager/rsync_stubs, as described by the si_mkrsyncd_conf man page.

=head1 REQUIRED STANZAS

The following stanzas are required in this file for it to function
properly.

  list = yes
  timeout = 600
  dont compress = *.gz *.tgz *.zip *.Z *.ZIP *.bz2 *.deb *.rpm *.dbf
  uid = root
  gid = root
  use chroot = yes
  log file = /var/log/systemimager/rsyncd

The 'dont compress' stanza may include other types of files as well.
If you have a list of file extensions that you believe should be
included please send them to
I<systemimager-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.

=head1 REQUIRED MODULES

SystemImager uses the concept of B<rsync modules> very heavily for
image propagation.  The following modules are required for
SystemImager to function properly.

=over 4

=item B<[scripts]>

The scripts module must be defined so that the autoinstall clients can
fetch their autoinstall scripts during install.  The I<path> for
I<scripts> should be set to the same value as I<AUTOINSTALL_SCRIPT_DIR>
is set to in I<systemimager.conf>.

=item B<[boot]>

The I<boot> module, must be setup for the autoinstall process to work properly.
The I<path> for I<boot> should be I<AUTOINSTALL_BOOT_DIR> followed by the
specific boot directory.  For example:

  [boot]
  path = /usr/local/share/systemimager/boot

=item B<[$IMAGENAME]>

In addition to the two required modules specified about, there also
needs to be a module for every I<image> that you want available for
installation from your Image Server.  The I<path> entry for the image
should be I<DEFAULT_IMAGE_DIR> from the systemimager.conf file, with
the image's directory appended to the end.  For example:

  [rh71image]
  path = /var/lib/systemimager/images/rh71image

  [deb22image]
  path = /var/lib/systemimager/images/deb22image
  
  [mdk81image]
  path = /var/lib/systemimager/images/mdk81image

=head1 BUGS

When this file is autogenerated, it should take into account customizations
to systemimager.conf, and the autoinstallscripts, so that there is no unique 
information in this file.
