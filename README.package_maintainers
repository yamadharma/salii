Package Maintainers:

The standard SystemImager build process pulls source from our download
server. If you don't want it to do this when you do your builds, you
have two options:

    1) Do a "make get_source" ahead of time, and copy the contents of
       ./src/* and ./initrd_source/src/* to either /usr/src or 
       $HOME/src, and the build system will get the packages from 
       there instead of downloading them at build time.

    2) Do a "make complete_source_tarball".  This will download all the
       necessary source, and will create a single source tarball
       that you can use for your build process.  
       
       NOTE:  This tarball will be quite large, as it will contain 
              source for the kernel version defined for each 
              architecture.  At some point we hope to use the same
              kernel version for all architectures, but for now, many 
              architectures are using different versions.
