Building and/or Installing SystemImager from Source

distribution.  If you must build SystemImager yourself, here are a few tips:

    o Refer to the Makefile for details.
    o Makefile targets you are probably most interested in:

        all
        install_client_all
        install_server_all
        install_boel_binaries_tarball
        install_initrd

    o For a list of all possible Makefile targets, you can try this command:

        make show_targets
