Quick Start
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A script named like this one (99all.harmless_example_script) -- that 
is, two digits followed by "all", then a period ".", then a 
description "harmless_example_script" -- will run for _all_ of your 
clients and images. 


How pre-install scripts are processed
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- They are run before the auto-install script (that means before the
  partitioning and the imaging) and they can perform any pre-imaging
  configurations. 


- Each script is tested for non-zero exit status, and the install will
  "shellout" if any of the scripts exits with non-zero status.


- Scripts should be named in this way:
  
  Two digit number to indicate order within a class.
  | Class name.
  | |  Period, followed by your description of the script.
  | |  |
  | |  |
  v v  v
  99all.harmless_example_script

  Classes include: 
  - all             (all clients)
  - $IMAGENAME      (i.e. ubuntu7_04)
  - $GROUPNAMES     (i.e. Login)
  - $BASE_HOSTNAME  (i.e. node)
  - $HOSTNAME       (i.e. node07)
  
  Scripts are ordered and executed first by class, then by number within 
  a class.
